# TriviaGame - Good Job, Brain! Themed

## Decription

This is a simple browser trivia game designed to challenge the user to answer 6 trivia questions from any of the 3 possible randomized quizes. 

This particular game is themed around the podcast Good Job, Brain! 

This game: 
* Randomly selects 1 of 3 possible quizes
* User has 30 seconds to answer question
* Correct and Incorrect answers are counted and displayed at end of game.

## Problem:
Create a quiz that gives users a limited amount of time to answer and shows multiple answers to choose from. In the end the user should see their score.

## Solution: 
- Store questions as objects in an array
- Create a timer using setTimeout(), setInterval(), and clearInterval()
- Use the javascript to dynamically generate the quiz questions and available answers
- Test chosen answer to see if it matches stored answer
- Keep track of right and wrong answers
